# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a professional readme generator, using node, and the inquirer npm package, to prompt the user in the terminal, where the user inputs whatever details they want to include in their readme, and then have the file be created and formatted using standard conventions.

## Installation

The user needs to have node installed, as well as run the npm i inquirer@8.2.4 function in their terminal as those large modules are hidden in the github repository using git ignore. Those two steps are necessary to properly execute the application in your terminal.

## Usage

Once all the files are properly installed simply run the JavaScript file using node (e.g node index) and then fill the prompts with your desired information, upon completion your README.md file will be added to your develop folder. You can use this application to easily create a well formatted professional README for any of your github coding projects. This project can also be used as a way for me to review the introductory lessons on using node, and installing npm packages.
